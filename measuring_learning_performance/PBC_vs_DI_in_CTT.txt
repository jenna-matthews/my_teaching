This is one of the most difficult concepts in CTT. 
Here is my explanation (in my own words):
The point biserial correlation compares getting an individual question correct with scoring highly on the test overall. A high correlation means that students who get that item correct are very likely to score well on the test. A correlation of 0 means that there is no relationship between a learner's score on that item and their score on the test. It is possible for the two (item & test) to be negatively correlated, which means that doing well on the item correlates with a poor overall test score.  
Point biserial correlation (PBC) is very similar to discrimination index. The key difference is the population the metric uses. PBC uses every test taker while Discrimination index uses the top & bottom groups.

* difficulty level is calculated by dividing the number of correct responses by the number of test-takers
* discrimination index uses the top/bottom group of scores for the population and compares the score on the item to the score on the test overall
* distractors are 'good' if they are equally likely to be picked by a test-taker that doesn't know the answer. A distractor that is never picked isn't a good distractor and should be removed/replaced.
* PBC uses ALL the test results and compares the score on the item to the score on the test overall.
