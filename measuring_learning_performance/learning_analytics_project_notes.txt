4160 Learning Analytics Notes

Learning Analytics data is – as a rule – considerably more messy than performance data. In our previous section we worked with the snapshots of test/quiz (performance) data, which can be analyzed using a variety of psychometric methods. In this section, we are looking at behavior, changes over time, and telling a story. 

To tell the story, as I mentioned in the section overview, we have to define a behavior of interest both as a concept (words) and as a formula (math/data manipulation steps). Then we can look at that behavior – as it changes over time – and compare it to outcomes like test/quiz scores or course-level results (pass, fail, withdraw).

I have added three csv files to this module. Throughout all the files, some columns are consistent. For example, code_module and code_presentation identify the course. The id_student code identifies the same student across all three files. For the purpose of this assignment, I have limited the data set to a single course. 

1.	studentVleDeets.csv: This has activity data for student activity. The date is a simple counter, relative to the first day of the course. sum_click gives a count of user clicks – which can be used to determine the volume of student activity. Finally, activity_type has a variety of categories, including forumng (forums) and homepage and oucontent. 
2.	studentAssessmentsOfInterest.csv: This has assessment activity for students. The data of interest here includes the score (student grade on the assessment) and date_submitted.
3.	studentOutsSingleFile.csv: This has one row per course-student with their final result (Pass, Fail, Withdrawn) and date_unregistration (withdrawal date) where applicable.
