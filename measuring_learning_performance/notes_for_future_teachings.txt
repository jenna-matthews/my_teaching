The assignment “Calculating Performance Metrics” needs additional clarity around what methods (CTT vs IRT) are meant to be used and a reminder about how students should be grouped to calculate those metrics.

Also this is a good breakdown:

^^ definitely use both of these if I teach a class like this again

Also, students have indicated (see survey results) that it would be helpful to have some videos to explain the different concepts/modules.
