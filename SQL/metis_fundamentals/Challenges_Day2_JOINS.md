# Challenge 2: Queries and Joins

This challenge focuses on combining and viewing our soccer data in interesting ways. Take a look through the GUI interface to get a feel for what data resides in each table and how you might approach different tasks we covered in the slide deck. Also, feel free to go above and beyond the list below!

## Challenges

Let's introduce joins as we seek to find answers to higher-level questions:

1- Which team scored the most points when playing at home?

2- Did this team also score the most points when playing away?

3- How many matches resulted in a tie?

4- What was the median tie score? Use the value determined in the previous question for the number of tie games.

5- How many players have Smith for their last name?

6- How many have 'smith' anywhere in their name?
                      
7- What percentage of players prefer their left or right foot?
