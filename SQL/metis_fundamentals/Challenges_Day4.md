# Challenge 4: Advanced Management

This challenge focuses on using the three concepts learned today (Constraints, Indexing, Views) to analyze the [European Soccer SQLite database](https://www.kaggle.com/hugomathien/soccer/downloads/soccer.zip) from Lesson 1.

## Challenges

1. Create a view that combines country and league information.
1. Drop the view.
1. Create a new view with only Big 5 leagues.
1. Now create another view that shows the home and away teams for the Spanish 2015/2016 season.
2. Build a view of your choice and share on the #general channel
3. Index the `Player` table.
4. Run a few queries and determine if there's an improvement in speed.
5. Look through the default constraints in this dataset; are there any you would add, change, or remove?
6. What do you notice about the relational structure of this database? Would you change anything to ease data lookups?
