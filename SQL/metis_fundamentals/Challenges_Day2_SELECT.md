# Challenge 2: Queries and Joins

This challenge focuses on combining and viewing our soccer data in interesting ways. Take a look through the GUI interface to get a feel for what data resides in each table and how you might approach different tasks we covered in the slide deck. Also, feel free to go above and beyond the list below!

## Challenges

Let's focus on the `Player` table: 

1. Select all players who weigh over 200 lbs.

2. Sort the above query with the heaviest players first.

3. Who are the three heaviest players?

4. Select all players who weigh less than or equal to 140 lbs and are taller than 185cm.

5. How many results did you get?

6. Select all players who weigh less than 140 lbs OR are shorter than 140cm. How many results did you get?

7. Count the number of players between 170cm and 190cm, inclusive.

8. Theoretically, how would you create a `category` column and label players over 190cm as tall, those under 170cm as short, and the rest as average?

9. Find players with birthdays on February 29 (leap day).

10. Create a `weight_kg` column using the [conversion formula](https://www.unitconverters.net/weight-and-mass/lbs-to-kg.htm).

11. Calculate [player BMIs using the metric formulation](https://www.cdc.gov/nccdphp/dnpao/growthcharts/training/bmiage/page5_1.html) into the `BMI` column. Note: we're not saving `weight_kg` so it needs to be computed in the overall formula.

12. Calculate the average BMI of all players.

13. Calculate the average BMI of players born on February 29.

14. Which group has lower BMI?
