some ideas for ways to teach/talk about bell curves:
... bifurcated (see Jay Lynch 2022 LAK paper) 
... normal where it shouldn't be normal (see Jurassic Park (book) graph of compy size)

what do you expect to see in the data? 
should it be normal?
should it have a single peak? 
should the peak move over time?
